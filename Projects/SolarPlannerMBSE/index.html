							<p style="text-align: justify;padding: 0 2.5em;">Drivers in urban environments are often exposed to varying levels of solar 
								radiation during their commutes, which can lead to health conditions, discomfort, increased 
								fatigue, and reduced overall driving efficiency. Conventional navigation systems prioritize 
								the shortest or fastest routes but do not account for environmental factors such as sunlight 
								exposure. The goal of this project is to develop a solar aware route planner for vehicles that 
								minimizes sun exposure while maintaining efficient travel times. The system integrates real time 
								solar and weather data from external data centers, calculates shadow parameters, and applies optimization 
								techniques to generate personalized driving routes. Using systems engineering principles, the project 
								defines functional and structural requirements, identifies potential failure modes, and ensures that 
								the final solution is reliable, efficient, and aligned with driver comfort and safety needs.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;padding: 0 2.5em;">The following report documents the design and development of solar route planner using systems engineering 
								methodologies. It details the all system engineering tools used across project life cycle from understanding 
								customer needs through tools like customer affinity process, functional and structural modeling using activity 
								diagrams, FFBD, IDEF0, QFD. The report also covers risk analysis and testing of product using FMEA, VCRM etc. 
								Overall, it documents the use of different systems engineering tools  for the design and development of user 
								centric product.</p>

								<p>The Customer Value Proposition is a systems engineering tool that defines how a product meets customer needs, and how those needs will be addressed. It links critical customer requirements to essential design features, ensuring that the system remains user focused throughout the design process. The CVP translates high priority customer needs, derived from competitor analysis and project goals in QFD, into actionable value propositions for the product.</p>
								<p>Using the CVP, we were able to identify the most critical requirements for the solar route planner and understand how these requirements could be met through the systems features. It provided a holistic view of the system deliverables to the user. Insights from the CVP laid the foundation for subsequent tools, such as the annotated concept sketch and the tests, by clearly highlighting which features and functions were essential to deliver maximum value to the customer hence deciding which requirements from originating requirements to focus upon.</p>

									<p style='margin:0'>The Annotated Concept Sketch is a systems engineering tool that provides a high-level visual representation of a systems structure, key functions, and critical components in a single diagram. It offers a holistic view of how structural and functional elements interact with each other and with the external environment. For the solar route planner project, the annotated concept sketch combined both structural and functional components, illustrating how data centers collect weather and solar data, how the model processes this information to calculate efficient routes, and how the system guides the user along the chosen path.</p>
									<p style='margin:0'>For this project, functional annotated concept rough sketch is created after defining initial originating requirements and later refined into the structural and functional combined sketch after CVP definition.</p>
									<p>Using this tool, we were able to understand the key structural components of the system, understand their interactions, and determine which data is transmitted between subsystems. It helped us better define the system from users’ perspective, which helps to inform about the system to wider non-technical audience. The insights from the annotated concept sketch also guided further design work, including refining data requirements in the context diagram and generating additional use cases for the system, ensuring that all major interactions and dependencies were clearly captured for subsequent development.</p>

									<p style='margin:0'>The Customer Affinity Process is a systems engineering tool used at the beginning of the project to understand customer needs, expectations, and pain points. It involves gathering and analyzing customer input to identify key areas for improvement and desired features in the system. For the solar route planner project, this process helped to capture user preferences and expectations on early stages, guiding the initial definition of system requirements. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>Using this tool, we were able to identify the main pain points of users, as well as additional features they expected in the system. For example, aesthetic user interface is highly recommended feature as per the results. </p>
									<p>This allowed us to better define the initial functional requirements and potential enhancements to make the system more appealing and user focused. Insights from the Customer Affinity Process also helped in forming the initial originating requirements and use cases for the system, providing a strong foundation for subsequent design and development work for user-oriented system.</p>

									<p style='margin:0'>A context diagram is used to represent the system as a single entity and shows how it interacts with external system, user and data sources. It focuses only on the system boundary and information exchanged across it. It doesn’t talk about the internal details of the system. In this project the context diagram established holistic view of how route planner model interacts with the surrounding environment. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>In our project, the context diagram was developed after obtaining results from the customer affinity process and after identifying the initial set of requirements. At this stage it is used to refine the understanding of data transfer of systems with external systems like data server. By creating this diagram, it became clear that which component was under our control and which were outside the system control. This helps us better define system scope, additional use cases to have a robust system. For example, although system depends upon the sun position data from the datacenter, the data center itself is not part of system as shown in figure.  </p>

In our workflow it is defined after context diagram where we enumerate specific scenarios the system must support user interaction and rank them by priority as Low, medium, high.

User stories are defined during the implementation stage of the system documenting the stakeholder conversation and design actions taken to fulfill the requirement. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>User cases let us understand the different user scenarios under which the solar route planner must operate. Additionally, it tells which use cases are more important. While the user stories make us understand how those use cases are implemented in our system by documenting stakeholder expectations and outcome of the implementation as shown in confirmation section of user story.  </p>
									<p>User stories let us better define the originating requirements to make those requirements more user focused. It also helped us define the final implementation result for each use case in the later stages. The next natural step after defining use cases was to explore interactions between different use cases using use case diagrams and to convert key use case cases into use behavioral diagrams to refine operation level requirements.</p>

									<p style='margin:0'>Use case diagram was created after defining the use case list and assigning priorities to each use case. It provides visual representation of how different use cases interact with each other and with user from functional point of view. Unlike use cases where every use case is listed in isolation, the diagram help us elaborate how one case can trigger each other. Through this diagram, we learned how major operational scenarios are connected and how system behaves in different scenarios from user perspective. The diagram better helps to define the expected system behavior from the view of functional priorities. For example, the diagram shows system attempts to use real-time data by default(includes) and switches to offline data(extended) when real time data is unavailable, clearly representing both interaction and priority.  </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>This exercise led to further design work by giving additional functional requirements. Also, it helped identify user-critical requirements that must be satisfied for reliable systems operation. </p>

									<p style='margin:0'>A use case behavioral diagram is used to elaborate high level use case by breaking it down into a functional flow across different stakeholders. While use cases capture what the system should do at high level, the UCBD translates that into sequence of action items and decision-making points. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>The UCBD was created after defining the use case to convert high level requirements into precise and quantifiable requirements necessary for systems operation. This tool helped us understand how system should act internally and how it should interact with external subsystems to achieve given objective. It helped better define originating requirements by reducing ambiguity. For example, the use case “user wants to add an intermediate stop during the journey” was initially broad requirement. Through UCBD, this was broken down into specific requirements such as the number of stops user can add, how stops are selected on map and how they are integrated into route planning as shown in figure. </p>
									<p>These other requirements are generally ignored or handled in a less collaborative way which can lead to integration problems at later stages. Having this precise requirement helped reduce uncertainty. This work further led to the creation of the Operational description tree (ODT), where the interactions and interfaces identified for given UCBD.</p>

This tool allows engineers to visualize interaction between different solutions to make informed decisions before finalizing systems architecture. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>Using combination table, we understand for verification of updated routes is related to recalculation of new routes. Also, which solution of route calculation can be paired with verification methodology. For example, when using a multi objective function optimization algorithm, the threshold for calculation is already updated, so verifying new route efficiency can rely on these parameters without requiring additional user input. In contrast, a machine learning based sun prediction model using only sun exposure data requires user confirmation which basically accounts for time required to reach to destination as shown in figure. </p>

									<p style='margin:0'>IDEF0 is a systems engineering tool used to model the major functions of a system and the data required for each function. While the function flow block diagram defines the sequence of functions and their interaction and decision-making points, IDEF0 in system architecture definition focus on understanding the inputs, outputs, controls and mechanism for each high-level function. It provides hierarchical view of function operations and the associated data flow, helping to understand how information moves through system. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>IDEF0 was used to analyze the data flow within the route planner model for example, the route planner model has level 2 functions such as initialize model and plan route as shown in figure. </p>
									<p>The initialized model function creates a loaded base map with the current location, destination and stops, which is then used by plan route function to calculate the final route.  Using IDEF0 we could understand which data is essential for each high-level function, which subsystem generates data and where it is consumed next. This tool also allowed us to define the system by breaking down functional architecture into a hierarchy and identifying inputs and outputs for each operation at different levels. The information from IDEF0 guided further design work, including subsystem allocation to create a more cohesive system. Additionally, this data can be used further for interface definition in ODT. </p>

									<p style='margin:0'>Failure Mode and Effect Analysis is a tool used to identify potential failure modes in a system to analyze their causes and effects, and prioritize them based on risk. It also tracks the implementation and impact of risk mitigation strategies, providing a structured approach to enhance system reliability and safety. FMEA integrates severity, likelihood, and detection measures to guide decision-making for reducing critical failures. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>Using FMEA in this project, we could identify which failure mode is caused by which causes and associated criticality of each failure mode. Additionally, it helped determine which failure causes needed urgent attention and what corrective actions were effective in reducing associated risks. For example, for failure mode F.3 severity dropped from 4 to 2 after increasing the frequency of update for weather data. </p>
									<p> This tool allowed us to better define the risk criticality associated with each failure cause, track the impact of mitigation actions, and ensure that design changes effectively reduced system vulnerabilities. Insights from FMEA then guided further design work to minimize potential failures and improve overall system robustness.</p>

									<p style='margin:0'>Fault Tree analysis is a systems engineering tool used to evaluate the probability of system level failures by showing the logical relationships between failures of individual subsystems to the overall system outcome. While FMEA focuses on detecting failures at the subsystem level, fault trees help identify which combinations of events or subsystem failures can lead to critical system level issues, providing a quantitative understanding of system reliability. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>This tool allowed us to better define the causes and probabilities of such failures at the system level. Using this tool, I was able to identify which functionalities contributed most to the probability of system level failures. For example, the highest risk of suggesting a non optimal route was traced back to weak GPS signals using the fault tree.   </p>
									<p>Based on these insights, further design work was implemented to improve GPS robustness by adding a dead reckoning system that uses internal sensors to verify GPS data. This reduced the probability of weak GPS from 0.7 to 0.2, lowering the chance of non optimal route suggestions to 0.24, thereby improving overall system reliability.</p>

									<p style='margin:0'>SysML parametric diagram is a diagram used to model mathematical constraints and relationship between different system parameters. It is developed during the detailed definition of the system to check if system is behaving as expected or not. </p>
									<p style='margin:0'>Using this tool, I understood how different parameters of systems are mathematically related to each other. It also helped me to understand whether given methodology will give me desired route efficiency value or not. For example. In the diagram what will be the different route efficiency values I can get for different conditions of sun exposure intensity (w_ij) and weightage combination for a different route segment (d_ij).  </p>
									<p>It helped me better define what should be the recommended weightage assigned to route distance needed to travel (w_route) and sun exposure (w_sun) experienced to get more comfortable experience to driver. It helped me finalize the optimum value of weightage I should be assigning to time and sun exposure which helped me to make standardized test for the functional behavior of the system.</p>
